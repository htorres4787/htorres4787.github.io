  <h4>Short Bio</h4>

  <p>I am a person that aims to be the best he can be and overcome challenges whether it be a physical and mental disturbances.</p>

  <p>I love everything technology, I am also in the process of modding my Xbox to play PS2 games. I started from hacking a online game to modding my systems through the help of Youtube/Google.</p>

  <p>When I am not playing video games, I am watching anime or reading a book. My favorite book series is the "Bluford" books, I highly recomend it for people who like young adult novels.</p>
